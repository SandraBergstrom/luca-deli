# Luca Deli

Welcome to the Luca Deli project! This endeavor began as a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of Figma and to translate a design vision into a fully functional webpage using HTML and SCSS. The project embodies a conceptual vegetarian deli brand, focusing on sustainability, luxury, and the convenience of enjoying high-quality, plant-based delicacies at home.

## Project Overview

Luca Deli represents my journey from design to code. Starting with Figma, I created a design that encapsulates the essence of a vegetarian deli's digital presence. Following the design phase, I brought the concept to life using HTML and SCSS, focusing on responsive design principles and modern web standards.

## Design

The design phase was meticulously carried out in Figma, where I aimed to capture the essence of Luca Deli—a brand that marries the sophistication of gourmet food with the principles of environmental consciousness. The user personas, including the "Environmentally Conscious Party Planner" and the "Health-Conscious Luxurious Consumer," guided the design process, ensuring the final product resonated with the target audience's needs and values.

### User Personas

- **Environmentally Conscious Party Planner**: A vegetarian event planner looking for unique, tasty, and eco-friendly catering options.
- **Health-Conscious Luxurious Consumer**: Prefers vegetarian options for a healthier lifestyle and indulges in high-quality food for weekend treats.

### Color Palette:

The color scheme of Luca Deli is a sophisticated blend of natural tones, each chosen for its symbolic significance and contribution to the overall aesthetic of luxury and sustainability. Here's a detailed look at the palette:

1. **Deep Forest Green (#013220):** This rich, dark shade of green adds depth and sophistication. It symbolizes a strong connection to nature and underscores the brand's focus on sustainability and quality.

2. **Light Olive Green (#789262):** A softer, lighter green that complements the deeper forest green. This color conveys freshness and naturalness, perfect for highlighting the green, vegetarian aspects of the "home luxury bag."

3. **Creamy Off-White (#F1F1EA):** This subtly warm shade of white serves as an excellent background color. It offers a clean and soothing sensation, making it easier for other colors to stand out and speaks to the simplicity and purity in the brand's design.

4. **Light Beige (#CBC8B6):** A neutral, earthy color that provides a balanced and harmonious feel. Ideal for creating a sense of calm luxury and for accentuating the brand's exclusivity.

5. **Dark Charcoal Grey (#1A1716):** This almost black hue delivers a strong and elegant impression. It is best used in small doses to create contrast and depth, as well as to add a modern and sophisticated touch.

This color palette combines sophisticated and natural tones to evoke a sense of luxury and sustainability, forming the backbone of Luca Deli's visual identity.

### Typography:

**Headlines**: Playfair Display for a luxurious feel.<br>
**Call-to-Actions**: Lato for clarity and modernity.<br>
**Body Text**: Roboto for readability and comfort.

## Development

The development phase brought the Figma designs to life. Using HTML and SCSS, I crafted a responsive front-end that faithfully represents the envisioned design across various devices. The project was developed in Visual Studio Code, with version control managed through GitHub, showcasing effective collaboration and code quality management.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The backbone of the project, structuring the web content and layout.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling, allowing more variables and nested rules for cleaner CSS.
- **Bootstrap**: Integrated to ensure responsiveness and to implement a consistent design system quickly and efficiently. The use of Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities helped in achieving a mobile-first design that adapts seamlessly across all devices.
- **Figma**: All designs were initially created in Figma, facilitating a visual blueprint for the webpage's layout, colors, and typography.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
- **SCSS Architecture**: Utilizes the power of SCSS for efficient and maintainable styling.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Figma Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience with Figma, learning how to use its tools to create detailed web design mockups.
- **From Design to Code:** Developed the ability to accurately translate design concepts into functional web pages.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques:** Enhanced understanding of SCSS, including variables, mixins, and nesting, to write more efficient and maintainable CSS.

## Summary

Luca Deli's web design project is an exploration of translating a detailed design concept from Figma into a responsive and aesthetically pleasing website. It underscores my journey in learning design tools and web development technologies, focusing on user-centered design, sustainability, and the luxury of vegetarian cuisine.
