# Luca Deli

Welcome to the repository for Luca Deli, a project where I ventured into the world of design and coding by taking on the challenge of learning Figma and then translating a design concept into a functional webpage. This endeavor was an independent effort to enhance my skills in both design and web development.

## Project Overview

Luca Deli represents my journey from design to code. Starting with Figma, I created a design that encapsulates the essence of a vegetarian deli's digital presence. Following the design phase, I brought the concept to life using HTML and SCSS, focusing on responsive design principles and modern web standards.

### Design

The design phase was conducted in Figma, where I aimed to create a layout that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. You can view my Figma design here: [link to figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8UQXTDyFDgVEoU50DqRkoe/Luca-Deli?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=15XNAGwIs9Xnic6i-1)

### Implementation

For the coding phase, I chose HTML and SCSS to translate my design into a functional prototype. This choice allowed me to practice semantic HTML markup and advanced CSS features, such as variables and nesting, provided by SCSS.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures that the webpage is accessible and visually appealing across a variety of devices.
- **Modern Layout:** Utilizes modern CSS features, including Flexbox and Grid, to achieve a layout that matches the design concept.
- **SCSS Architecture:** Employs SCSS to organize stylesheets in a modular and maintainable way.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Figma Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience with Figma, learning how to use its tools to create detailed web design mockups.
- **From Design to Code:** Developed the ability to accurately translate design concepts into functional web pages.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques:** Enhanced understanding of SCSS, including variables, mixins, and nesting, to write more efficient and maintainable CSS.

## Project Status

This project is a showcase of my learning journey and is currently not intended for commercial use. It serves as a testament to my dedication to learning new skills and improving my craft in web development and design.
